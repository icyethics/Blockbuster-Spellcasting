Blockbuster: Spellcasting is an API mod that adds a new mechanic to Balatro, with Spells. Spells are effects that can be cast by both jokers and playing cards. To showcase, the mod comes with a deck that enables spellcasting. The core mod adds Spells based on the vanilla suits (+ additional functions to account for wild cards), and is set up to allow mod developers to add spells for their own, new suits, as well as add general spells, and jokers that interact with it
